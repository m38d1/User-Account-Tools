Create Hidden Administrator User Account in Windows

You might have observed that during Windows 10 installation set up when you complete installation Windows 10 creates two additional user accounts that are hidden by default. One is a guest account which is very limited, and the other is the administrator account. The difference between the created user account and the built-in user account is that the built-in account is an elevated account (administrator) and will not give UAC prompts.

Windows automatically generates this elevated, hidden Super Administrator account which remains hidden by default owing to security reasons. The built-in Administrator account is usually used to troubleshoot Windows and therefore should only be used during troubleshooting. Unlike the normal Administrator account, this hidden by default or built-in Administrator account runs all programs and tools with admin rights by default.

   1- Download Useraccounttools.bat 
   
   2- After that, open the saved file by right-clicking on it and choosing the option ‘Run as administrator’.
   
   3- Choose any Options you need of list
   
   4- Done :)
